  I		am	 that 	merry			 wanderer 		of 			the           night.
          I 	jest 		to 		Oberon 		and 	make		 him 				smile
                 When	 I 		a 		fat 	and 	bean-fed 		horse 	beguile,
               Neighing		in 	likeness 		of 	a 		filly 		foal:
      And       sometime			lurk 	I 			in 	a 			gossip's	bowl,
In      very	 	likeness      of      a      roasted     				crab,
	And 	when 		she 	drinks, 	against      her       lips          I  bob
      And 	on	 her       wither'd			dewlap 		pour 	the 				ale.
