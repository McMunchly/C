	I 	see 		in         your    eyes    the 	same     fear     that       would
        take       the		heart      of           me.       The           day           may    come   when           the       courage       of           Men           fails;           when     we      forsake    our friends       and       break		 all 	bonds 			of     fellowship;       but    it  is       not        this         day     -		 an     hour      of        wolves       and     shattered           	shields, 		when		    the       Age   of  Man        comes 	crashing 		down     -  		but				it    is       not        this       day!!!    This		day		we	fight!		By        all    that     you     hold        dear		on		this		good		earth -               	I bid you stand!
